Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your machine, such as GCC or Clang. You can check if you have GCC installed by running gcc --version in your terminal or command prompt.

Create a new file called driver.cpp in a directory of your choice and paste the provided code into the file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the driver.cpp file is located.

Compile the program by running the following command:

For GCC: g++ driver.cpp -o driver

For Clang: clang++ driver.cpp -o driver

This will create an executable called driver.

Run the program by executing the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

./driver
