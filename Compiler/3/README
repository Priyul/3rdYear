To compile (using windows):
1. Install a c++ compiler (WSL)
2. Navigate into the folder directory
3. Run the command:
make

To run:
After typing make, run the program using:
./main

The program reads input from a file called '*.txt'
*PROGRAM READS FROM A TEXT FILE INPUT AS IS GIVEN IN P2, NOT FROM AN XML FILE*

The symbol table outputs into an HTML file named 'index.html'
It also outputs in the terminal if the scope analysis was successful.

Appropriate errors are thrown, caught and displayed in the terminal if there are scoping errors. Warnings are also displayed in the terminal for uncalled processes.

Naturally, the HTML file is not written if an error is caught.
