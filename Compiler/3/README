To compile (using windows):
1. Install a c++ compiler (WSL)
2. Navigate into the folder directory
3. Run the command:
make

To run:
After typing make, run the program using:
./main

The program reads input from a file called '*.txt'
The abstract syntax tree outputs into an xml file named 'output.xml'
It also outputs in the terminal if the parse was successful.

Appropriate errors are thrown, caught and displayed in the terminal if there are lexical or parse errors.
Naturally, the xml file is not written if an error is caught.
